# Fellow Dashboard

An all in one place you could stay in during your fellowship.

# üí° The idea
During the fellowship, you have multiple people to meet, multiple tasks to do, multiple platforms to do all this at. The first two are fun but so many platforms not so much. But what if we could give you one platform for all? Have your meeting schedule, your Github discussions, Github stats, LMS, Topic box everything in one place? Then we have exactly what you(we) need!

# ‚öôÔ∏è Features planned
A dashboard which would have the following "widgets":
- [ ] Welcome page with Fellowship details
- [ ] Github stats with all the issues and PRs recently made
- [ ] A calendar with your schedule and events lined up
- [ ] A Github discussions embed so you can post your stand up notes
- [ ] A link to the LMS(Trainual)
- [ ] A link to Topic box for clear communication with your pod
<br/>... more coming soon

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
cd frontend

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
